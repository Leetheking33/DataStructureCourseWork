lab 01
Enter your chosen Unix environment.  For the word ‘command’ assume it is a one line command unless explicitly stated otherwise.  

*******************************************************************************
*********State what command(s) you used to accomplish each task.***************
*******************************************************************************

1. What unix-based OS you are using (Ubuntu, Fedora, OSX, etc...)?
uname -a

Linux Relek-VirtualBox 4.15.0-29-generic #31-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jul 17 15:39:52 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

2. What are command line options (also called parameters)?
Command line options are a list of commands within the assembler that can be
used within the command line to make tasks simpler or preform a task.

3. What are ALL the files in your home directory (the directory you start in) whose name contains the word ‘bash’?  What command did you use?
leetheking33@Relek-VirtualBox:~$ ls
csci-315-spring-2019  Documents  examples.desktop  Pictures  Templates
Desktop               Downloads  Music             Public    Videos

There was no file that contained the word bash in the title so I used grep to see which files in the system contained the word "bash".
grep -rn "bash" * This is the command I used.
Files containing the word "bash":
csci-315-spring-2019/lab01/unix-commands.txt
csci-315-spring-2019/course-materials/lectures/src/01-install-bash.tex
csci-315-spring-2019/course-materials/lectures/src/02-basic-unix.tex
csci-315-spring-2019/course-materials/lectures/src/01-introduction.tex

4. Create a new directory in your home and call it lab01.
mkdir Lab01

5. Create a directory inside of lab01 named lab01sub while still in the home directory.
mkdir Lab01/Lab01Sub

6. Create a file inside lab01sub named readme.please.txt, the file can be empty
cat > readme.please.txt then press ctrl + d. This will create an empty txt file.

7. What is the full (absolute) path of lab01sub? What command did you use?
/home/Lab01/Lab01Sub

8. If your present working directory is lab01, name three 1 line commands that will return you to your home directory?
cd ..
cd
cd ~

9. Copy the readme.please.txt (that is in the current working directory) file into your home directory (not the directory named home, the top level directory of your personal files)
cp readme.please.txt -t ~

10. Rename this new file to be useless.txt
mv readme.please.txt useless.txt

11. Explain what |, <, >, and >> do when used on the command prompt.
>> apends to a file
> sends output to file, overwriting it
| takes the output of one command and passes it to another
< redirect standard in

12. What is the difference between * and ? in filename wildcards?
? is any single character, except a leading dot
* is zero or more characters, except a leading dot

13. What command would you type in order to determine the number of lines in somefile.txt that do NOT contain HI hi Hi or hI?  Hint, grep is your friend.
grep -c ".*" somefile.txt

14. What 1 line command would you type to generate a file names.txt that contains a list of users currently on the system sorted lexicographically (default order of sort) (hint: who is on the system)?
cat > names.txt
leroy
ctrl + d

15. What does the –r option do for the rm command?  How about –f?  Hint: use man.
-r is recursive, is recursivly goes through a directory. -f obtains pattern from file

16. Is executing the command “rm –r *” from your home directory a good idea?  Why/why not (what would it do)?
No because -r on rm will remove until there is nothing left and will not ask you once it is done. So if you use it on your home directory it will get rid of everything.
